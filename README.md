The file NN.py contains the code to train an artifitial neural network to predict the future electromagnetic field.

In order to run the code the files "dsc_fc_summed_spectra_2017_v01.csv" and "dsc_fc_summed_spectra_2023_v01.csv" from https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/develop-the-oracle-of-dscovr-experimental-data-repository/ should be in the same folder as NN.py.
